I am a 23 year old OSWP, OSCP, and CSIE.  
You may recognize me as a moderator on [Infosec Prep](https://discord.com/invite/infosecprep) or being active in [The Official Offensive Security Discord server](https://discord.gg/ctBUcPuakZ).

This page will serve a tutorial point and as a public repo of my notes as I learn red and blue team tools and techniques.

Plus everyone can see what I am working on this way!
