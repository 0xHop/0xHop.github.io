I am a 23 year old Cybersecurity professional with 4 years of practical experience.  2 years of blue team and 2 years of purple team. 

You may recognize me as a moderator on [InfoSec Prep](https://discord.com/invite/infosecprep) or [The Official Offensive Security Discord](https://discord.gg/ctBUcPuakZ)  where I lead a lot of discussion/ shitposting in the WiFu Channel. 
(Morten give us the WiFu update, we are waiting).

I am going to be using this blog as way to assist the community and to publicize my notes as I go through my Infosec journey as well as some occasional personal life updates.

Feel free to reach out to me on any of my social media but preferably in the company of the active discord communities.
